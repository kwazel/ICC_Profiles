# General

This repository contains self made ICC profiles for the camera's I have access to.
The files I used to create these profiles are also included.
I used Argyll V2.1.2 on Linux for this process.

# Files

* `R180730.txt` contains calibration data from http://www.targets.coloraid.de/. Thank you Wolf Faust!
* `generate_profile.sh` is the script I used to generate the icc profile
* `Lumix_LX100_ISO200.RW2` and `Nikon_D7500_ISO100.NEF` are the raw files from my camera's.
* `.icc` files are the ICC color profiles generated using Argyll. I have only tested them in Darktable.
`.tif`-files are edited files from these raw files, 16-bit tif with perspective correction.

# Copyright
All files except `R180730.txt` are created by me. I encourage everyone to use them.
Feel free to claim you created them, if that makes you feel great.
